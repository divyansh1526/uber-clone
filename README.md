# Uber Clone (MERN Stack)
**Status: Ongoing Development**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an Uber-like ride-hailing application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  
The application is currently under active development, with the initial focus on implementing secure authentication and role-based access for both Users (Riders) and Captains (Drivers).

The goal of this project is to replicate real-world backend and frontend architecture used in large-scale ride-hailing platforms.
